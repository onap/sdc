      order:
        description: 'The order of the NIC on the compute instance (e.g. eth2). Note:
          when binding more than one port to a single compute (aka multi vNICs) and
          ordering is desired, it is *mandatory* that all ports will be set with an
          order value and. The order values must represent a positive, arithmetic
          progression that starts with 0 (e.g. 0, 1, 2, ..., n).'
