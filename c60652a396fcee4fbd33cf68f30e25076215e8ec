      "message": "Make sure it doesn\u0027t accidentally remove legitimate multi-value headers. Here your assumption is that proxyMethod already has some headers you don\u0027t want to override/modify - the ones populated by addHeaders(user, proxyMethod) in line 121. I would probably explicitly filter out the headers managed by the simulator, and keep all the rest as it is. But even simply combining the two methods in a slightly different way can help prevent such problems in the future. \n\nBTW, have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3096888/standard-for-adding-multiple-values-of-a-single-http-header-to-a-request-or-resp",
