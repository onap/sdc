Feature: Heat Example File
  Scenario: Test with update for heat file and check for validation warning
    Given I want to create a VLM

    When I want to create a VSP with onboarding type "NetworkPackage"
    Then I want to make sure this Item has status "Draft"

    When I want to upload a NetworkPackage for this VSP from path "resources/uploads/BASE_MUX.zip"
    And I want to process the NetworkPackage file for this VSP

    When I want to download the NetworkPackage for this VSP to path "resources/downloads/base_mux.zip"
    Then I want to check property "data[0].file" for value "CB_BASE.yaml"
