I can think, for example, of asych writing to the log, in which case the message about may never be written (depending on the implementation). I might be wrong, but something really bad must happen to justify System.exit() from deep within a program. On the other hand, System.exit can and should be used in main() to make the program shell-script-friendly. In this case an exit status can be checked if the program prints out/writes to log and doesn\u0027t throw an exception from its main().",
