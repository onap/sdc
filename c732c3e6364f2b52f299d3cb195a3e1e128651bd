      "message": "you should not throw a NullPointerException, that is what Java already does to you automatically. You should handle the situation where the information you need/want is null, which can vary depending on what you want to do. \nIf that is something really necessary for the runtime system, as it seems to be here, a custom runtime or checked exception could be thrown here, for example PortalAPIException.\nThat could also be thrown in the method getUserBusinessLogic(), as it is returning a dependency of this class. This dependency in fact could be injected during the creation of the class, being something mandatory for the class to work/be instanciated.\nThe same comment applies to the others NullPointerException thrown.",
