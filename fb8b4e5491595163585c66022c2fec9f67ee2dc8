      "message": "This change would mean that the marking of a req or cap as external on a component instance would be lost when the version is updated.\nThe original code was flawed in that any reqs/caps not marked as external were lost. \nI think the correct solution is:\nwhere a req/cap has been marked as external in \"resResourceInfo\", update the existing definition in the req/caps in \"component\". Note there may not be a corresponding cap/req in \"component\" in which case nothing needs to be done for that req/cap",
