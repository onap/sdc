/**
 * <p>Client-visible API for logging, implemented according to
 * <a href="https://wiki.onap.org/download/attachments/1015849/ONAP%20application%20logging%20guidelines.pdf?api=v2">
 * ONAP application logging guidelines</a>. The actual implementation is delegated to a service provider bound through the <a
 * href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html">Java SPI</a> mechanism. The provider must implement {@link
 * org.openecomp.sdc.logging.spi.LoggingServiceProvider}.</p>
 * <p>The logging API collects the following types of data:</p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Context that must be propagated throughout the application, and available at any point for debug and error
 *     reporting.</li>
 *     <li>Audit data, reflecting the invocation of a local, usually REST, API.</li>
 *     <li>Metrics data, reflecting the invocation of a remote API by current system (component).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>The construction of all three types of data follows the same pattern for consistency. The builder pattern has
 * been chosen over an interface to enable to gracefully add new fields without affecting the client code. Also, the
 * builder can be implemented differently if needed, also without affecting client code. For instance, it may delegate
 * the instantiation and population of a data object to the service provider.</p>
