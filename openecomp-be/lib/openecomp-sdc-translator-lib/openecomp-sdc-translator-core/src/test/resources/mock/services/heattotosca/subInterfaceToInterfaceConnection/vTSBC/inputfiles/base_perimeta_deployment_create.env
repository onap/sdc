# Template for instantiating
#  - 1xHA SSC instance
#  - MxHA RTP MSC instances
#
# This Heat template commissions, partners and configures the Perimeta
# instances with minimal configuration defined by the following templates.
#  - ssc_a_template.json
#  - msc_a_template.json
# This/these can be modified as required to obtain the required Perimeta
# configuration.
#
# This template puts the Perimeta configuration in place using userdata
# injected via OpenStack's ConfigDrive mechanism.
#
# This template sets up anti-affinity using server group anti-affinity and
# optionally availability zone anti-affinity.
#
# This template will work with any version of Perimeta software from 3.9.20.
#
# Pre-requisites are:
# - existing networks as follows
#     - network for management traffic
#     - network for HA traffic
#     - network for core/trusted service traffic
#     - network for access/untrusted service traffic
# - pre-loaded Perimeta image
# - suitable flavor to use for Perimeta SSC
# - suitable flavor to use for Perimeta RTP MSCs
# - suitable flavor to use for Perimeta MSRP MSCs
# - suitable keypair to use for Perimeta
#
# Virtual IP address and fixed IP addresses to use for the Perimeta instances
# must be provided as parameters.
#
# Template requires Juno or above and has been tested on Kilo.  Note that in
# some deployments, Heat template validation will fail but actually creating
# a stack using the template will succeed.   This is due to problems with
# Heat validating nested templates.
