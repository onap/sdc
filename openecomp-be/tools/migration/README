	Name:		1607 to 1610 ASDC VSP migration tool
	Version:	4.0
	Date:		15 Sep, 2016

General -
	This is a utility used for migration of VSP data from ASDC version 1607 to version 1610.
	This utility will be executed post upgrade process to 1610.
	This utility must run from the ASDC backend (BE) machine.

	From version 3.0 the tool can be run several times without changing a VSP version more then once, the first time.
	Once the VSP is "fixed" it will not be migrated by this tool.

Concept -
	Once migrating ASDC from 1607 to 1610 changes were made in the VSP load/validation.
	In order to support these changes and force a valid HEAT file upload, the migration process should be
	run on the existing data.
	Not doing so will result in VSPs that will not open for update action.

	The migration will run on VSPs that were upgraded from 1607 to 1610 and are not able to be retrieved.

Pre ASDC upgrade requisite -
    In order to achieve the best result from this tool users must check-in ALL VSPs.

Limitations -

	* Will not work if user did not create a first version of the VSP, i.e. at least one time check-in action.
	* Once run, user must checkout a VSP, go to General and re select a license model version.


Usage -

	Note: There are default values if the script is run without arguments.
	      The values are credentials: cs0008/cs0008,  with host: 127.0.0.1
	1607_to_1610 -h                            --> get help
	1607_to_1610 -a <username>/<password> [-ip {ip}]
	Example:
		using cassandra on localhost  - 1607_to_1610 -a root/secret
		using cassandra on remote host - 1607_to_1610 -a root/secert -ip 10.147.97.191

	Result:
		The migration result will be listed in a CSV file: upgradereport.csv
		"None" is an indication that the VSP was not in a checkout status prior to the upgrade.

	Exmample for a valid output:
