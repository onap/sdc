      "message": "There is no upgrade scenario implemented in the onboarding init solution.\nI could not find also a way to add a column only if it does not exist when using a cql script.\n\nAs a workaround, I\u0027ve kind of activated the use of an alter_table.cql script (it was being added to the init docker image, but not being called), and added the alter tables there. \nThe alter_table.cql result is being ignored, so it will not guarantee a successful upgrade. I believe if one cql command fails, the next ones will not be executed, and I also could not find an error handling in cql scripts.\n\nI could, though, split every single command (3 for now) in a separate file and force the execution of all commands if wanted (ignoring the result).",
