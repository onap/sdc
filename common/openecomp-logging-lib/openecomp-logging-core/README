The purpose of this module is to make a Web application meet the OPENECOMP logging requirements described in
OPENECOMP platform application logging guidelines.

The default out-of-the box solution is based on SLF4J.

It introduces three major areas of functionality as follows:

1. Routing of logging messages for the Logback library, so that all logging events are written to separate files
according to their type.

2. An AOP aspect for measuring execution time and logging it, so that the application code is not contaminated with
this type of logging.

3. Collecting and populating the context of a Web API request and propagating it to every logging event.

TODO:

1. MetricsAspect
  - Configurable metrics message
  - Make sure there are no exceptions but applicative ones

2. EventTypeDiscriminator
  - Make event types configurable to make the names of log files easily customizable

3. DispatchingAppender
  - Read appenders from configuration, so that there is no need in EELF loggers
  - Simpler use of discriminator or an entirely different mechanism
  - Better appender name pattern, or mapping between a discriminating value and an appender name
  - Discard the appenders cache on configuration changes
