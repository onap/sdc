      "message": "I\u0027m actually trying to shrink the size of `ArtifactsBusinessLogic` and to encapsulate the state of `ArtifactDataDefinition` (in other words to prevent unnecessary exposure of its state). In the future, this method may be a private one. The overall goal is to maximize the \"Tell don\u0027t ask\" principle and the Law of Demeter:\n\n- https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter\n- https://pragprog.com/articles/tell-dont-ask\n- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/157526/explanation-on-how-tell-dont-ask-is-considered-good-oo\n\nSo for now, could we keep this as is until we get a better idea about the behaviors assigned to `ArtifactDataDefinition`? Maybe we\u0027ll figure out another object but for now I rather centralize what interacts with its state, and to encapsulate whatever possible.",
