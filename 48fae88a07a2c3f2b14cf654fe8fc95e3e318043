(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html)\nIf it does not passes serialization there is no need in serialVersionUID.\nI am not aware of Sonar warning regarding this class serialVersionUID.\nYou can either change you IDE settings if you have this warning, or add an suppress annotation @SuppressWarnings(\"serial\").",
