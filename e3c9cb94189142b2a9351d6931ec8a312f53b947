      "message": "I understand the API is returning a 400 in case of 404 if the VSP is not being in use, so this solution will work on this case. But it is not clear if this was a VSP not being in use or something else.\nIn a supposed scenario, maybe the API changed and the client is now really broken, doing a bad request. This code will just return empty, saying that the VSP is not in use, which could not be the case.\nWe should do a better error handling to differentiate a VSP not in use from other errors. We probably need to match a HTTP status along with an expected message from the API.",
