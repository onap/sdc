  A Proxy-CSCF (P-CSCF) is a SIP proxy that is the first point of contact for the IMS terminal. 
  It can be located either in the visited network (in full IMS networks) or in the home network 
  (when the visited network is not IMS compliant yet). 
  Some networks may use a Session Border Controller (SBC) for this function. 
  The P-CSCF is at its core a specialized SBC for the User network interface which not only
  protects the network, but also the IMS terminal. 
  The use of an additional SBC between the IMS terminal and the P-CSCF is unnecessary and 
  infeasible due to the signaling being encrypted on this leg. 
  The terminal discovers its P-CSCF with either DHCP, or it may be configured 
  (e.g. during initial provisioning or via a 3GPP IMS Management Object (MO)) 
  or in the ISIM or assigned in the PDP Context (in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)).
