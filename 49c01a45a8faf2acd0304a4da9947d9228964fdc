To the best of my understanding, vnfrepo configuration belongs to SDC onboarding, which uses a different configuration mechanism. Moreover, it will run as a separate deployment unit very soon. It doesn\u0027t make any sense for catalog-be have a configuration file for it other than the parameterized template BE-vnfrepo-configuration.yaml.erb, which is copied into ${JETTY_BASE}/config/onboarding-be/config-vnfrepo.yaml during deployment.",
