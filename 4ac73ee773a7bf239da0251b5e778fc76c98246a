      "message": "I agree this tests were useless (maybe checking if no exception is thrown). They were made just for coverage.\nStill, I wouldn\u0027t remove them. \nValidationUtils uses regular expressions in most of its methods and it\u0027s potential weakness. This class needs to be covered with tests. \nI\u0027ve created JIRA for this:\nhttps://jira.onap.org/browse/SDC-1468\n\nPlease leave this tests since they can serve as base for proper units.",
