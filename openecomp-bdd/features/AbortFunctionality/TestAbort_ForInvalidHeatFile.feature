Feature: Abort Flow

  Background: Init
    Given I want to create a VLM

  Scenario: Test abort functionality , Check validation data for invalid heat
    When I want to create a VSP with onboarding type "NetworkPackage"
    Then I want to make sure this Item has status "Draft"

    When I want to upload a NetworkPackage for this VSP from path "resources/uploads/errorHeat.zip"
    # abort
    When I want to delete for path "/vendor-software-products/{item.id}/versions/{item.versionId}/orchestration-template-candidate"

    When I want to get path "/vendor-software-products/{item.id}/versions/{item.versionId}"
    Then I want to check property "onboardingOrigin" does not exist
    Then I want to check property "candidateOnboardingOrigin" does not exist
    Then I want to check property "validationData" does not exist

    When I want to upload a NetworkPackage for this VSP from path "resources/uploads/errorHeat.zip"
    When I want to process the NetworkPackage file for this VSP
    # validation data should have been updated as heat is invalid
    Then I want to get path "/vendor-software-products/{item.id}/versions/{item.versionId}"
    Then I want to check property "validationData" exists

    # abort - processed invalid file and check validation data
    When I want to delete for path "/vendor-software-products/{item.id}/versions/{item.versionId}/orchestration-template-candidate"

    When I want to get path "/vendor-software-products/{item.id}/versions/{item.versionId}"
    Then I want to check property "onboardingOrigin" does not exist
    Then I want to check property "candidateOnboardingOrigin" does not exist
    Then I want to check property "validationData" does not exist
